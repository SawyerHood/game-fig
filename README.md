# GameFig

GameFig is a Figma plugin that runs a game boy emulator inside of Figma! The game output is rendered as SVG so you can scale the screen how you please. The entire game state is stored inside of the Gameboy layer so you can copy and paste the layers to create save states and even paste them between files.

## Install

GameFig hasn't been published on the Figma community yet, but you can install it locally. Start by cloning this repo. Then you can do the following:

```bash
git submodule init
git submodule update
npm install
npm build
```
